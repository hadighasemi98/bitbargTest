# Task Management System

## Overview

This project is a Task Management System designed to challenge the technical skills of candidates in PHP, Laravel, PostgreSQL, Redis, and Docker. The project focuses solely on APIs and backend functionality, evaluating the candidateâ€™s ability to implement secure, well-structured APIs, handle role-based permissions, and work with modern backend technologies.

## Features

1. **User Authentication and Authorization**
   - Secure user registration and authentication using Laravel Passport.
   - Define roles (e.g., admin, regular user) and permissions.
   - Check if users have access to specific tasks or projects based on roles and permissions.

2. **Task Management**
   - Users can create tasks with a title, description, assigned user(s), and due date.
   - Tasks can be marked as completed or pending.
   - Users can update task details, mark tasks as completed, or delete tasks.

3. **RESTful API**
   - Secure API routes for tasks, users, and authentication.
   - Include CRUD operations for tasks and users.
   - Secure endpoints with proper authentication.
   - The task list endpoint includes robust filtering and searching functionalities.

4. **Database Design**
   - Design a PostgreSQL database schema to store user information and task details using Laravel Migrations.
   - Utilize relationships between users and tasks.

5. **Caching**
   - Use Redis to cache frequently accessed data, such as task lists or user information.

6. **Middleware for Permissions and Roles**
   - Implement middleware to check if users have the necessary roles and permissions to access or modify tasks.
   - Ensure only authorized users can perform actions like creating, updating, or deleting their own tasks.

7. **Security Measures**
   - Use Laravel's built-in password hashing for user authentication.
   - Validate and sanitize all user inputs to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS).
   - Implement logging mechanisms to track and audit user actions, especially for sensitive operations.

8. **Dockerization (Optional)**
   - Dockerize the application for easy deployment and scalability.
   - Use Docker Compose to manage application services (Laravel, PostgreSQL, Redis).

## Docker Setup

To build and run the application using Docker and Docker Compose, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Build the Docker Images

Run the following command to build the Docker images:

```sh
docker-compose build
```

### Step 2: Start the Docker Containers
Run the following command to start the Docker containers:
```sh
docker-compose up -d
```

### Step 3: Run Migrations and Seeders
After starting the containers, you need to run the migrations and seeders to set up the database schema and initial data. Run the following commands:
```sh
docker-compose exec app php artisan migrate
docker-compose exec app php artisan db:seed
```
